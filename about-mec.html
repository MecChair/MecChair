                    Since 2005, The Metropolitan Undergraduate Engineering Society (MUES), formerly Ryerson Engineering Student Society (RESS) has hosted the Engineering Competition. Over 250 of Metropolitan's brightest engineering students compete each year in one of eight competition categories. All competition categories will challenge participants to develop unique solutions to several problems within the engineering industry. MEC hopes to expand beyond the limiting circumstances and host the competition in more innovative and creative ways.

                    In this two-day event, students will have the choice of competing in one of the nine categories. The top three ranking teams in each category will have the opportunity to compete in the Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC). MEC will facilitate equal opportunity for all competitors to compete in their respective environments.
